## Introduction

This is class assignment for exploratory data analysis.
In this project data is obtained from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.

## Loading the data

Please note that there is a code 'initialize.R' need to be in the foldere along with all other codes and data. It is assumed that data is in same folder and default file name has been set. 


## Making Plots

Use any of plotX.R codes where X=1,2,3 and 4. Also note that png files are given. Given that data and all the codes are in same folder, to produce plot1.png it is enough just to run plot1.R.
